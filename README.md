## Ezmake, a useless tool (makefile for idiots) which will probably never get noticed (Just like the rest of my repository).

## Basically gets each line and uses (system) to execute it for you. File name has to be <Ezmake.ezmk>. Involves .o file for linux and .exe (CMD only)

## Makefile but worse. Please dont' use it. Ever. Just a project for fun late in the light.
